				<h3>Personal Website</h3>
				<p>When developing my personal website, I wanted to portray a professional impression with a twist of creativity. Some may believe that a professional website should refrain from creativity and the use of vibrant colors. However, I am developing a career in web development. Because of this context, the target market for my website is going to be impressed by interesting designs and dynamic content. I wanted to create something that is visually engaging and modern to allow me to push the boundaries of the traditional personal website. I decided on creating a website using a scrolling parallax. A scrollig parallax consists of a single page that performs animations and transitions as the user scrolls down the page.</p>
				<p>Throughout my website, there are five sections: intro, what i do,  about me, resume, and contact. I strategically chose these sections so that could provide a brief introduction and then go in-depth about my skills as the user scrolls down the page. In the intro section, I display my name, title, and a macbook pro. I chose the macbook pro because they are the epitome of a developers machine. I placed a slider as the macbooks screen to create a dynamic and creative aspect, which makes it look like there is actually a small macbook pro inside the users screen. </p>
				<p>In the  what I do section, I display the main fields I specialize in. Again, the icons and text slide up from the bottom of the screen to emphasize the scrolling parallax. This section provides an abstract for the resume section, where I go in-depth about my skills in these fields.</p>
				<p>
				Next is the about me section, which contains a profile picture and information about where I go to school and where I work. I placed the about me section after the what I do section, because it simulates interaction in person. Userâ€™s will continue to scroll down if they are interested in what I do so they can then learn more personal information about me. 
				The resume section is essentially my resume in a web page format. I used skill bars that animate to get the users attention, and also colors to further engage the audience. On the left I place my work experience, and on the right I place my skill bars to show how proficient I am in each skill. I wanted to use the skill bars because they provide a quick way to present my skill levels to the audience. </p>
				<p>Finally, the contact section allows th e user to contact me if they are interested in contracting me for a project or just interested in finding more information about me.</p>
				<p>In order to transistion from my personal website to the blog website, I created a promotional flyout component in the bottom left of my personal website. This flyout slides up from the bottom of the page and links to the blog website which contains the remaining assignments for this project. The flyout can also be closed if the user does not want to go to the blog website. I added this flyout because I felt that the additional items need to complete the project did not flow well with the scrolling parallax</p>
				<h3>Blog</h3>
				<p>When the user clicks the link to my blog website from my personal website, they are taken directly to my blog. First I want to describe the layout of the blog. I created a simple three tab website that consists of the blog, this reflection and my projects. I used a very new technology called AngularJS aid in creating the website. Using AngularJs I was able to allow the user to click on other tabs in the menu and load new pages without the page refreshing. This is accomplished by making asynchronous requests to load the new content. </p>
				<p>My blog is about one of the newest technologies in web development. In the design of my blog, I wanted to incorporate the logo of nodejs. I did this by placing it in the background of the blog and making it responsive so it would size correctly when resizing the screen. The image at first made it difficult to read the text so I placed a black gradient over it to darken the image. This made the text much easier to read.</p>
				<h3>My Projects</h3>
				<p>I wanted to display the projects I completed in class through the use of tiles. Each tile would consist of an image, title and description of the project. All the projects would then link to a Github repository that contains all of the files for the project. I did this because I felt it was the cleanest way to display the projects and easiest way for users to be able to access the files. </p>
